# ActiveDirectory-PoSh-Scripts
The intent is to gather together a few of my common PoSh scripts that I use in conjunction with generic Active Directory tasks. This may have some overlap with other areas, but I'll try to keep the scripts in this repo to specifically AD helper scripts

AD-Telephone-sync.ps1
---------------------
This script is intended for techs to mass upload telephone numbers to Active Directory

ZoomTXT-AD-Compare.ps1
----------------------
For those times you are running low on Zoom licenses and needing to check and see how many terminated users you having wasting your licenses

Create-Restricted-Room.ps1
--------------------------
When you're needing to create a restricted meeting room for a breakout room, executive, or otherwise. This allows you to specify the room, create an AD Security group, and add an initial member
